This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError. The `calculate_average` function is designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where the input list is empty or contains only zeros, which leads to a division by zero error. The solution provided demonstrates how to correctly handle these edge cases to prevent such errors.
